# AB-MOEA
Surrogate models have been widely used for solving computationally expensive
multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). The ecient global optimiza-
tion (EGO) algorithm, a Bayesian approach to surrogate-assisted optimization,
has become very popular in surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization. In
this paper, we propose an adaptive Bayesian approach to surrogate-assisted
evolutionary algorithm to solve expensive MOPs. The main idea is to tune the
hyperparameter in the acquisition function according to the search dynamics to
determine which candidate solutions to be evaluated using the expensive real
objective functions. In addition, the sampling selection criterion switches be-
tween an angle based distance and an angle-penalized distance over the course of
optimization to achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation.
